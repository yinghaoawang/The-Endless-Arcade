# Asteroid Souls
## Time spent programming: 24 hours

#### 24 hours?!
Yeah, I got hooked on programming this. I wanted to finish this game with all features that I envisioned before I slept. Unfortunately I was only able to program it for 21 hours straight. I woke up the day after and finished it up in 2 hours. 

#### So many features for a 1 day game
I wanted to just make a basic asteroids game, but the more features I added, the more I wanted to put.

Also, I admit I went over the 1 game a day limit. But it's because I had to learn Phaser.js, and set up my server to save high scores!

#### What's with  the name?
I also put a different spin on the game. I wanted emphasize on the difficulty of the game while keeping it rewarding. That's why I named it Asteroid Souls, an ode to one of my favorite single player series, Dark Souls.

I also wanted to add more replayability by adding levels, and NG+, etc. But, you know, a game a day time constraints.
