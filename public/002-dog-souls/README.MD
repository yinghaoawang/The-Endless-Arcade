## Time spent programming: 12+ hours

## Post Mortem:
Definitely thought I could finish this much faster. It's cus this time I tried to be more organized, and I spent
at least 3 hours on understanding the differences between Node.js, regular JS, and ES6. 

I might have to make the next 3 games in Unity in order to catch back up on schedule, but I'm sure I will be glad to return to Phaser.
