Begin	->
		Chance of good event 10-30%
		Chance of bad event 10-30%
		Initialize city price mean
			
Turn	-> 
		Chance of bad event, then reset to 10%
		otherwise increase chance of bad event	+2%
		Chance of good event, then reset to 10%
		otherwise increase chance of good event	+2%
		
		Increase cost of all items by 2%
		
		foreach city
			foreach item
				Normalize item quantities based on min items, max items, and average price
				Adjust Prices
